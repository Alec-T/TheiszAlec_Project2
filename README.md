# TheiszAlec_Project2
This is my project 2 submission for SOAD-S 210. My project aims to portray an online experience of procrastination and work-avoidance. I often use the internet to distract myself from my work, and I get frustrated with the difficulty of my online work as well. Give more time, I would add more webpages to this project.
